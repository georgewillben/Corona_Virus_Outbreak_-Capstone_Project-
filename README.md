# Corona Virus Outbreak


## Introduction
In this project I gain insights about the 2019-nCoV outbreak and healthcare policies. I also create forcasts to predict how the virus might spread and what its effects may be. This is my capstone project for Flat Iron School's data science boot-camp.
### Problem Statement
2019-nCoV is spreading fast and has the potential to become an epidemic, I have a few goals to help governments and health organizations gain insights about the outbreak. 
#### Goals
1) Gain insights into how / where the virus might spread. (Exploritory Data Analysis)
2) See if certain policies had an effect on the rate of infection and mortaility rates. (Hypothesis Testing)
3) Use time series analysis to forecast the spread of the disease as well as the death rate. (Time Series Modeling)
4) Use a recurent neural network (RNN) to forcast the spread of the disease as well as the death rate. (Deep Leaning)


## Overview of the Corona virus outbreak



## Basic Facts
### Corona Viruses
* Corona Viruses are a group of viruses that cause respitory tract infections [1].
* Some of the most lethal forms include SARS, MERS, and 2019-nCoV [1].
* "There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections" [1].
### 2019-nCoV
* 2019-nCoV has an estimated mortality rate of one to five percent [2]. 
* "Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath" [2]. 
* 2019-nCoV has a incubation period of two to fourteen days [2]. 
* The disease spreads through people coughing and spreading small droplets of fluid [2].
* The outbreak is belived to have started in Wuhan, China in 2019. [3]
* The outbreak consists of over 144,000 cases [3].
* The outbreak is considered a pandemic and has been reported in 130 countries and territories [3].
### SARS
* SARS had a mortality rate of %9.6 [4].
* SARS has simular symptoms to 2019-nCov [4].
* The incubation peroid of SARS is roughly four to six days [4].
* SARS spreads the same way 2019-nCoV does.
* The SARS outbreak started in Guangdong Province, China in 2002 [4].
* The outbreak consited of  8,098 cases [4].
* The SARS outbreak was large and was reported in seventeen countries [4].
* "No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004" [4].
